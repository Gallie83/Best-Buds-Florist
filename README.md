## Wireframes

* These wireframes were produced in [Figma](https://figma.com). I made frames for a full width display and then modeled for smaller screens once I had designed the full width diplay. The finished site varies slightly from the wireframes due to developments that occured during the creation process.

* For smaller screens I created a second navbar that would replace the original. I did this as the original navbar looked very messy on smaller screens. In this navbar I replaced the business logo with an elegant font that is also used in the image carousel.

## Design Choices

### Logo

* I used [Logo](https://logo.com/) to create the Best Buds Logo. I really like the simple, legible design of it and it immediately grabbed me when I saw it.

### Colour Scheme

* For the colour scheme of this website, I wanted to use a palette with earthy tones that complimented its products. After searching through many colour palettes I decided on this one. I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to browse through the colour schemes.

* I decided on this palette as I felt it really complimented the Best Buds logo.
